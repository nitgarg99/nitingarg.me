## How's it going?

I am a graduate computer science student at USC, living in Los Angeles, CA. 

My goal is to invent something new. I'm always looking for fresh ideas and different perspectives. I work hard and love
what I do.


Check out my projects below to get an idea of my work. My contact information is at the bottom of the page if you are
interested.
